### Week 4 Assignment
As always start off by forking and cloning this repository from Github. Open the code in Atom to get started.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't forget to _keep the existing code as is_ and ignore any code that is commented: `// -- DON'T TOUCH CODE BELOW --`.

Finally, remember `console.log()` is your friend and you can use it in conjunction with the browser console to see the output of your code as you go.

### Part 1: Arrays
Inside the `assignment` folder you will find a file called `arrays.assignment.js`. Open that file and follow the instructions outlined in the JavaScript comments (denoted with `//`). For this assignment you are given function signatures and will be asked to code the body of the function.

### Part 2: Objects
Inside the `assignment` folder you will find a file called `objects.assignment.js`. Open that file and follow the instructions outlined in the JavaScript comments (denoted with `//`). For this assignment you are given function signatures and will be asked to code the body of the function.
